# Nix Darwin Kickstarter

 An extensive demo featuring a plethora of configurations that can serve as a reference for your setup. However, exercise caution, as it may **OVERWRITE** your system configuration. **DO NOT** deploy it directly to your system.


## How to Start

1. install nix
2. download this repo
3. change hostname and username
4. run 'nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes' run nix-darwin -- switch --flake .'

## Configuration Structure

Your current nix-darwin configuration's structure should be as follows:

```bash
› tree
.
├── flake.lock  # a lock file generated by nix, you can ignore it for now
├── flake.nix   # the entry point of your nix configuration, you need to add your hostname here
├── home        # home-manager's configuration folder, help you manage your dotfiles & user-level apps.
│   ├── shell.nix     # customize zsh's dotfiles
│   ├── core.nix     # user-level apps from nixpkgs(nix's official package repository)
│   ├── default.nix  # home-manager's entry point, you need to import all other nix files in home folder here.
│   ├── git.nix      # customize git's dotfiles
│   └── starship.nix  # customize starship's dotfiles
├── Makefile    # a Makefile to simplify your nix-darwin workflow.
├── README.md
└── modules     # a folder contains all your nix-darwin configuration files
    ├── apps.nix        # contains all your homebrew & nix apps(both GUI & CLI)
    ├── host-users.nix  # defines your hostname & all your system users
    ├── nix-core.nix    # nix's core configuration, you can ignore it for now
    └── system.nix      # defines your macOS's system configuration(like dock, trackpad, keyboard, finder, loginwindow, etc.)
  ```
